# QUIZ
This quiz consists of 4 questions. For each question, you will write a command to the shell. Then, you must copy your command and paste it into the `main.sh` file provided. The `main.sh` file is how we will check which commands you used for each question.

Note: Make sure you are in the `~/COMP100-2021F-Lab1` directory before proceeding.

## Q1
Create a file `quiz.sh`. Append `#!/bin/sh` to `quiz.sh`.

## Q2
Modify the permissions of `quiz.sh` so that everyone has read, write, and execute permissions.

## Q3
Append a command to `quiz.sh` that will extract your profile details from `profiles2021/<your-first-name>.txt` and print it on the terminal ie: if you run the `quiz.sh` file, it should print its contents to the shell's terminal

## Q4
Write a command that will copy all the files from `profiles2020` to `profiles2021`
